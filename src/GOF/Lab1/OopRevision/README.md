# Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

A GitHub repository explaining fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java.

## Polymorphism

Learn how polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, facilitating flexibility and extensibility in Java programs.

## Abstraction

Discover how abstraction allows you to define the structure of classes while hiding implementation details, enhancing code maintainability and reducing complexity.

## Interface

Explore the concept of interfaces, a crucial feature in Java that defines a contract for classes to implement, promoting code reusability and achieving multiple inheritances of behavior.

## Encapsulation

Understand encapsulation, a fundamental OOP concept in Java, where data is hidden from direct access, ensuring data integrity and allowing controlled access through methods.
