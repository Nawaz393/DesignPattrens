# Iterator Pattern

The Iterator pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to traverse elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation (list, stack, tree, etc.). The Iterator pattern decouples algorithms from containers; in some cases, algorithms are necessarily container-specific and cannot be decoupled. However, in many cases, algorithms can be decoupled from containers, and the Iterator pattern allows you to do this.
