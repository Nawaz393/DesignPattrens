# Visitor Pattern Example - Computer Parts

This repository contains a simple Java implementation of the Visitor Pattern using computer parts as a scenario. The Visitor Pattern allows you to separate the algorithm from the object structure on which it operates, making it easy to add new operations without modifying the objects themselves.

## Overview

In this example, we have defined a set of computer parts:

- `Computer` represents a computer.
- `Monitor` represents a computer monitor.
- `Keyboard` represents a computer keyboard.
- `Mouse` represents a computer mouse.

We want to perform different operations on these computer parts without modifying their classes. This is where the Visitor Pattern comes into play.
