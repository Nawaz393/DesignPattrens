# Observer Pattern Example

This repository contains a simple Java example of the Observer design pattern.

## Overview

The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects. When one object (the subject) changes its state, all its dependents (observers) are notified and updated automatically. This promotes loose coupling between the subject and its observers, allowing for flexible and maintainable code.

## Usage

To run the example code, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE.
3. Locate the `Lab2.Observer.test` class and run the `main` method.

## Example

The `Lab2.Observer.test` class demonstrates the Observer pattern with a simple messaging system, simulating a chat room. Users (observers) can join the chat room, send and receive messages. Additionally, users can leave the chat room during the session to showcase detachment of observers.

Please note that this is a simplified example to illustrate the Observer pattern.
